# Assignment Web Application

Our assignment is about a React.js CRUD web application: 'Appointments page users', using React.js and Firebase.
The idea of this assignment is that it allows us to make an appointment for any field of booking sites.

The keys points in our assignment are:
1- Creating a new appointments.
2- Show details for existing appointments.
3- Modify(update) and delete appointments.

Then the React.js CRUD web application required pages to creating, show details and edit appointments data.
You're free to choose the right design for these pages, provided it is clear.
You must mention the basic information to book an appointment like basic user information, date and time..

BONUS:
******
4- Push a notification when a new appointment created in the same time of an existing appointment.
5- Track of all appointments in calendar view (similar to Google calendar) for the chosen date.
6- Edit appointments through this calender directly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evaluation will be according to the following points:
1- React.js and Firebase are required.
2- Clean code.
3- CRUD operations work properly.
4- Clear design and user friendly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
